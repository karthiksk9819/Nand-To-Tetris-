#Hack Assembler


### What is it?

This is an assembler built for the HACK computer from the Nand to Tetris Course.




### How to use it?
	
	1. Load all the assembly files into the Assembly files folder
	2. Run the Assembler batch file 
	3. That's it , you get all the associated output files in the 
	   output folder.




### Pre-requisites

	1.Python
	2.Win-Os



### How was it built?

The assembler was built using Python, some might consider it cheating because 
we're using a high level language to build it on which I do agree , however
as time is of the essence I just needed a working assembler to go through with
the course.
We can however build an actual assembler using Machine code , although doable
I feel it will take months to complete. A project for another time I suppose! 

This was built in a day and a half , the assembler works this way..

We have different functions that handle the IO operation and the main logic 
behind the assembler is just a bunch of nifty array and string manipulations.

Feel free to check out the code and offer a budding programmer good tips.
Thankyou for checking out my code ! :)
